Hello ! I is a first-year Ph.D. student at [OPTML Group](https://www.optml-group.com/) at Michigan State University, under the supervision of [Prof. Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/). My research centers around trustworthy, efficient and interpretable ML algorithms. 

I have been working on Machine Unlearning for LLMs, since the start of my PhD with the goal of removing harmful and hazardous knowledge in LLMs.
Currently, I am completing a summer internship at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov), where I am working on scaling zeroth-order (ZO) algorithms for ML. 

**Collaboration Opportunities**

I am always open to collaborations with researchers, as well as undergraduate and graduate students seeking Ph.D. positions. If you have exciting research ideas or are looking for opportunities to conduct research under professional guidance, feel free to reach out to me! 
<!-- Please refer to my [collaboration statement](./collaboration) for more details. You are also welcome to befriend me on [Wechat](./assets/img/Wechat.jpg) or connect me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhangyihua/). -->

<!-- 
**Research Keywords**: Machine Unlearning, Jailbreak Attack, Adversarial Training, Fairness, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Mixture-of-Experts, Model Sparsity, Large Language Model, Diffusion Model, Bi-Level Optimization, Zeroth-Order Optimization. -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
